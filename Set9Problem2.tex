\makeproblem{Eccostock example.}{emt:problemSet9:2}{
Use the expression for transmission function obtained above and the values and instructions below to plot the following at normal incidence:

\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet9:2a}
Transmission magnitude and phase as a function of frequency for the case \(N=3\).
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet9:2b}
The group delay as a function of frequency for the cases \(N=1, 2, 3, 4\).
\makesubproblem{}{emt:problemSet9:2c}
The group velocity as a function of frequency for the cases \(N=1, 2, 3\).

\begin{itemize}
\item \( n_i = 1 \) (this is air), \( n_j = 3.4 - j 0.002 \) (this is Eccostock).
\item \( d_i = 1.76 \,[\si{cm}] \)
\item \( d_j = 1.33 \,[\si{cm}] \)
\item \( L_{\textrm{PC}} = (N-1)(d_i + d_j) + d_j \)
\item Frequency range for all plots: \( 20 \,[\si{GHz}] \) to \( 23 \,[\si{GHz}] \).
\item Use linear scale for transmission magnitude (not \si{dB}) and express the transmission phase in Degrees.
\item Plot the group delay in nanosecond.
\item Plot the group velocity in units of \( V_g/c \), where \(c\) is the speed of light in vacuum.
\end{itemize}
